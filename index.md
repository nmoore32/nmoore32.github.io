My background is in physics and philosophy. I have a BSc and MSc in physics from Acadia Universty and the University of Toronto, respectively. I also have a BA and Ph.D in philosophy from Acadia University and the University of Western Ontario, respectively. I had planned to go into academia, however recent structural changes in academia have resulted in my choosing another career path. I now plan to get into software development.


# My Software Development Journey

I decided to start with Python (even though I learned some Java in university) since it allows me to focus more on learning concepts rather than syntax. But I'm also really interested in computer science and so have decided to work through Open Source Society University (OSSU) Computer Science education path. I'll keep this site updated with my progress on both routes.


## Python 

I decided to start learning Python using _Python Crash Course_ by Eric Matthes and _The Python Workbook_ by Ben Stephenson. You can find a finished version (aside from music) of my space invaders clone and solutions to exercises from _The Python Workbook_ in my respositories. Below is my overall learning plan for Python.

Finished
1. _Python Crash course_ by Eric Matthes
2. _The Python Workbook_ by Ben Stephenson

Current
3. LinkedIn Learning - _Become a Python Developer_ learning path

Next 
4. LinkedIn Learning - _Faster Python Code_ course
5. _Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming_ by Dusty Phillips
6. _Data Structures and Algorithims in Python_ by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser
7. _Learning Python_ by Mark Lutz
8. _Mastering Python Design Patterns_ by Kamon Ayeva and Sakis Kasampalis
9. _Python Cookbook_ by David Beazley, Brian K. Jones
10. _Mastering Object-Oriented Python_ by Steven F. Lott
11. _Fluent Python_ by Luciano Ramalho
12. _Effective Python_ by Brett Slatkin


## OSSU

I've only just decided to go through the OSSU cirriculum alongside Python. I also decided to start at the beginning since it will help cement what I've already learned.

Current
1. _Python for Everyone_

Next
2. _Fundamentals of Computing_
